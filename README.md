### Introduction
In this semester (Summer 2025), I got the course Operating System. And on the Lab of same course we required to build a project.

Our Faculty [Mr. Mahabubur Rahman](https://https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahbubur-rahman-58723333a/) said - "If you really want to understand how a Operating System Works you should build it." So here i'm building my own Operating System called ***"NO OS"***- (here NO doesn't have any full form yet. But suggest some, maybe "NO" means NO, or it could be-
- Not Okay
- Non-Operational 
or any other name suggest me üíÅüèª)

### My Vision
For learning purpose it has no works. But if it's succesfull one. Then i can maybe extend this with our linux enthusiast community [The Penguins Club](https://t.me/@The_PenguinsClub). Maybe we can build it for some special purpose like KIOSK OS or Server OS that runs only specific application. But for now let's build the Operating System from Scratch.
